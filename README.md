    ```

3. **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:**

    ```sh

    cd Housing_Backend
    npm install
    
    # Navigate to frontend directory and install dependencies
    cd ../Housing_Frontend

    ```

4. **Start the backend server:**

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Backend (Express.js + MongoDB)

Located in the `Housing_Backend` directory, this contains the server-side code and API endpoints for the Housing Services Website. It uses Express.js for the server framework and MongoDB as the database.

### Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

Located in the `Housing_Frontend` directory, this contains the client-side code for the Housing Services Website. It uses React for building the user interface and Tailwind CSS for styling.

- **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

- **Start the development server:**

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
